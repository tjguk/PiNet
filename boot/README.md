PiNet boot files (Legacy)
================

The PiNet SD card boot files were stored here up until (and including) the 3.18 kernel release. This folder is kept for legacy support for older versions of PiNet.   
All future SD card boot files updates can be found at https://github.com/PiNet/PiNet-Boot
